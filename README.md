# Rock, paper or Scissors? Which one will you choose?
<p>On this project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin's Project</a> I was challenged to create a fun game that most of us certainly have played at one point of our lives. It's supposed to be played mainly on the devtools' console so the html is looking far from catchy or good-looking at all. I do plan to come back on this project and style it a bit to make it more envolving and actually interactive.</p>
